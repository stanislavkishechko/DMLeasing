                How Does Leasing Work?
            </h2>
            <p class="how-does__text">
                Leasing a vehicle is essentially entering into a long term rental agreement for that
                vehicle. Unlike a traditional car purchase, you don’t actually own the vehicle. Instead, a
                leasing company purchases the vehicle from the dealer on your behalf and then you make
                monthly payments to the leasing company for the duration of your lease. Some leases however,
                do provide the option to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease.
            </p>
            <h4 class="how__does-title">
                Similar to a short term car rental, there are rules that define:
            </h4>
            <ol class="how-does-list">
                <li class="how-does-item">
                    How much you can drive, stated as annual miles (excess miles are charged at a specified
                    rate)
                </li>
                <li class="how-does-item">
                    Types of damage that you may be liable for at the end of your lease
                </li>
                <li class="how-does-item">
                    The procedures and costs when you return the vehicle at the end of your lease
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="how-does__text">
                Lease contracts are a commitment and ending them early can be difficult and expensive so it
                is important to consider your circumstances carefully before you decide.

            Important Things to Consider
        </h2>
        <p class="important__text">
            Depending on your circumstances and what is important to you, a lease could be a great option
            for your next vehicle. Below are some important factors that may influence your decision.

                <p class="important_item-text">
                    Monthly payments on leases are generally 20% - 30% cheaper than loans
                </p>

                    You may be eligible for a tax break if you use the leased vehicle for business purposes

            <li class="important__item">
